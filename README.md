# AudioDozer VCV Rack Plugins

This repo is sort of a dumping ground for my experiments while learning how to develop DSP modules for VCV Rack.
Work thru several books on the subject in addition to some online resources.  I plan on posting some notes here

## Capt. Crunch

This is a simple bitcrusher.  The "depth" knob will allow a user to cycle thru the various bitcrushing levels available.  Current available levels:

* 2Bit - All the way left
* 4Bit - Somewhere in the middle between 12 o'clock and far left
* 8Bit - Somewhere in the middle between 12 o'clock and far right
* 16Bit - All the way right

Once I figure out how use buttons and toggle switches within VCV I will trade the depth knob for something more user-friendly.  ;-)
